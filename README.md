# custom-linux-shell
The project was a home assignment in the operating systems course at Braude College of Engineering.
The goal was to create from scratch a custom Linux shell using OS function calls.
lec_pass.txt std_pass.txt and Courses.txt are used as the "database" for the project.
Sys_shell.sh is a script that compiles and executes the project with custom instructions.
